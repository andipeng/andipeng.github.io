I previously spent a summer at FAIR Robotics and two years as an AI Resident at Microsoft Research. I received a B.S. in Cognitive Science and B.A. in Global Affairs from Yale, where I played with robots with Brian Scassellati and read a lot of dead philosophers.\nI want to build agents that learn to adapt continuously from and with humans. For this to occur, we must 1) create an aligned language for humans to specify their desired objectives, 2) establish mechanisms for agents to communicate what they do and do not know, and 3) develop algorithms that allow for humans to provide information best equipped for downstream learning. I derive inspiration from the reinforcement learning, human-robot interaction, and cognitive science communities.\nA history buff at heart, I care deeply about creating a world where AI is used safely, ethically, and equitably. I believe connecting with non-academic communities is of paramount importance, and have worked at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), with the Partnership on AI, and at Schmidt Futures on AI policy. I also serve on the advisory board of the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.\nThe best way to reach me is andipeng [at] mit [dot] edu.
