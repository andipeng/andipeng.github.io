I’m intrigued by how decisions are made, in both humans and machines. By formalizing the cognitive principles that underlie how we learn and reason about our environment, I build systems that collaborate with humans to solve computational tasks. I also dabble on projects with AI for Earth.\nI find myself growing ever more concerned that the world isn’t using AI safely, fairly, or ethically. To that end, I've worked with Jake Taylor at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and with the Partnership on AI on understanding the impacts of technology. Our report on establishing standards for the deployment of criminal justice risk assessment tools can be found here.\nI received a B.S. in Cognitive Science and B.A. in Global Affairs from Yale, where I spent four wonderful years with Brian Scassellati. I'll be starting my Ph.D. at MIT CSAIL in Fall 2020.\nThe best way to reach me is andipeng [at] microsoft [dot] com.
