[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi there! I am a 2nd year CS PhD student researching away at MIT, advised by Pulkit Agrawal in CSAIL Embodied Intelligence. I previously spent two years as an AI Resident with Ece Kamar and the Adaptive Systems and Interaction Group at Microsoft Research. I received a B.S. in Cognitive Science and B.A. in Global Affairs from Yale, where I played with robots with Brian Scassellati and read a lot of dead philosophers.\nIâ€™m broadly interested in how adaptive learning emerges. By incorporating principles behind how humans effortlessly plan and reason in shifting environments, I hope to build artificial agents that learn to adapt continuously from and with humans. I derive inspiration from the reinforcement learning, human-robot interaction, and cognitive science communities.\nA history buff at heart, I care deeply about creating a world where AI is used safely, ethically, and equitably. To that end, I believe connecting with non-academic communities is of paramount importance, and have worked at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), with the Partnership on AI, and at Schmidt Futures to understand the policy impacts of AI. I also serve on the advisory board of the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.\nThe best way to reach me is andipeng [at] mit [dot] edu.
